# **Assisting Valuers in the Evaluation of Properties**

## **Introduction**  
This project aims to assist property valuers in evaluating properties through data analysis and visualization. Key trends and relationships between variables were explored to provide insights that facilitate informed decision-making in the real estate sector.  

## **Objectives**  
- Analyze a dataset related to properties to extract valuable insights.  
- Perform data cleaning and transformation to prepare a dataset ready for analysis.  
- Create useful visualizations to identify patterns and trends.  

## **Methodology**  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Identification of missing values and handling of inconsistent data.  
   - Descriptive statistical analysis to understand key characteristics of the dataset.  

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**  
   - Standardization of values and processing of categorical variables.  
   - Creation of new features based on relevant calculations for property valuation.  

3. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Use of visualizations to identify trends such as the impact of size, location, or additional features on property values.  

## **Tools and Technologies**  
- **Python**: Main language for analysis.  
- **Libraries used**:  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.  

## **Results**  
- Key features affecting property values were identified.  
- Visualizations provided insights into how factors such as location and size influence estimated values.  
- A clean and transformed dataset was prepared for future advanced analyses.  

## **Conclusions**  
The project highlights the importance of data analysis in the real estate sector. The visualizations generated offer a practical resource for valuers, allowing them to identify patterns and make better-informed decisions.
